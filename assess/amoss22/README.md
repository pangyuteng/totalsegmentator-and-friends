This is truly an impressive project, I can't even begin to fathom the amount of time and effort your team must have put into this, AND its all open source!

On top of my mind, I already know a few PIs that have existing research/cro projects that need this ASAP, since contouring of organs is done manually (oncology projects, with different organ focuses, liver, kidney ...) and any contour from CAD would be a tremendous time saver.

Below, I am sharing the dice computed from TotalSegmentator outputs versus manual contours in Pediatric-CT-SEG datasets (age ranging from 0 to 16) and AMOS 2022.
